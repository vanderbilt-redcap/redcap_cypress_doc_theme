# REDCap Cypress Step Definitions - Documentation Theme

This repo holds the theme used to publish the [Gherkin Step Builder]([url](https://vanderbilt-redcap.github.io/redcap_cypress/)).  For more details on cypress testing of REDCap, see the [REDCap Cypress Developer Toolkit](https://github.com/vanderbilt-redcap/redcap_cypress_docker/blob/main/README.md). 

This is the customized documentation theme for [documentationjs](https://documentation.js.org):
it consists of underscore templates and a few assets: a [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/)
theme and [basscss](https://basscss.com/) as a basic CSS framework.

The contents are the following:

* `index._`, the main template that defines the document structure
* `section._`, a partial used to render each chunk of documentation
* `assets/*`, any assets, including CSS & JS
